* [VAG] fix virtualbox setup process
	1 install vbox interface (load vbox environment!)
	2 install base config with sudo priviledeges
	3 install salt
	4 install vagrant instances
* [VAG] create vbox interface & check its ip addresss
* [VAG] while starting, fix vagrant interface according to the setup process

- [RPI] detailed installation process on progress label

- [VAG] remove redandunt files (apt-get autoremove, clean)
- [VAG] install language package (apt-get locale)
- Finish button to remove window
- change /etc/hosts of every datanode
- [RPI] send cluster member ip only when firstly setting up, or member changes

- Until all stopping process is completed, do not show complete indicator on menu
- Vagrant reload/reboot


- Install multiple packages
- Disable close button on installation
