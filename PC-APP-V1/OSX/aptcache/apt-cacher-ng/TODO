Download rate limiting (throttling)

Add expiration for installer images using SHA256SUMS or MD5SUMS (whichever is covered by the Release file)

Use cache control headers where possible

[for s.] root startup and EUID changing for privileged port use
[maybe, what was the urgent reason again...?!] Don't die if at leat one socket was open on start. Plus, retry to open sockets on HUP. document this... ifup can send hups?!
[debian] don't install acngfs manpage on hurd... or finally fix and build acngfs for hurd

It has advantages.  Would be neat if it could be served by
http://<server ID>:3142/logs.html (or something like that).  It would
have to generate a pick-list of the
/var/log/apt-cacher-ng/maint_*.log.html files ...

 - integrate generic mirror checker from Rakhesh

 - rethink option syntax of acngfs

 - consider creating Debian and Ubuntu security mirror setup, like:
 Remap-ubusec: file:ubuntu_security /ubuntu-security ; http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu

 - (maybe) get the additional index files for i18n (Translation*) and d-i files
   and parse them in expiration

 - better control of reconnect attempts limitation (recon. count) (Prio: low,
   external motivation required)

 - support detection and temporary or permanent blacklisting of dead peers,
   configurable with number of retries, maybe using background ping job or sth.
   (Prio: low, external motivation required) 

 - Document all options in the manpage (Prio: low)

 - (maybe) for import: smart mirror structure discovery... if _$ARCH.deb found but no
   binary-$ARCH data for them, try to locate binary-$ARCH folder positions in
   the cache

 - dynamic update/scrolling of the log pages

For 0.9:

 - Add Backports.org profile to the lists? Debian-Ports? Anything else?

 - For import, make it more controlable. Control page should offer checkboxes:
[] Thrust old apt-cacher metadata if found (skip file verification)
[] Learn index files locations from old metadata
[] Forced copy of imported index files (overwrites existing!)
[] Optimistic Precaching Strategy

 - write installation makefile target

For 1.0:

list the last error messages in the summary of maint logs
